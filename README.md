# grace-benchmarks

Benchmarks adapted from:

1. [Classification/tf_cnn_benchmarks](https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks/tree/cnn_tf_v1.14_compatible): The TensorFlow CNN benchmarks contain benchmarks for several convolutional neural networks.

2. [LanguageModeling/examples/PennTreebank](https://github.com/tensorpack/tensorpack): LSTM language modeling on Penn Treebank dataset.

3. [Recommendation/NCF](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/TensorFlow/Recommendation/NCF): This repository provides a script and recipe to train Neural Collaborative Filtering to achieve state of the art accuracy on the ml-20m dataset.

4. [Segmentation/UNet_Industrial](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/TensorFlow/Segmentation/UNet_Industrial): This repository provides a script and recipe to train UNet Industrial to achieve state of the art accuracy on the dataset DAGM2007.
